## About Saint Valor

Founded with an unwavering commitment to **quiet luxury** and exquisite refinement, Saint Valor emerged from a passion for jewelry that speaks softly yet confidently. We believe luxury should be felt, not shouted — through impeccable materials, thoughtful proportions, and pieces created to be treasured for generations.

At Saint Valor, every creation is an expression of **intentional elegance** — meant to celebrate personal milestones, timeless style, and discerning taste. Our collections stand at the intersection of **heritage craft** and **modern sensibility**.

This philosophy guides not only our jewelry, but also the **digital experience** we create.

## Styling Approach

Saint Valor’s design system is built using **Tailwind CSS** with a focus on:

- Soft neutrals and luxury tones  
- Generous whitespace  
- Elegant typography  
- Subtle interactions and transitions  

Reusable class combinations are managed with **`clsx`** for cleaner conditional styling.

## Backend Integration

This frontend is built to consume APIs from a dedicated backend service.

Typical integrations include:

- Product listings  
- Product details  
- Categories & collections  
- Cart & checkout  
- User accounts  

All API logic should be centralized in a **service or API utility layer** to keep components clean and maintainable.

- **Vercel**

- AWS / Docker-based hosting  

### Production Build

npm run build
npm run start
```

## Brand Philosophy in Code

Saint Valor is more than an e-commerce store — it’s a digital reflection of timeless elegance. Every spacing choice, animation, and layout decision is guided by the same principles as the jewelry itself:

**Refined. Intentional. Enduring.**
